                        <p>With this page I intend to showcase the skills and projects that I have built over the past year at Atlas School.</p>

                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>ive always had an interest in human and animal behavior, and a curiosity about how our brains work. my goal was to go into the field of neuroscience and research, but i had an opportunity to study machine learning at Atlas School. I thought it would be an amazing opportunity to become familiar with many of the ML and data science techniques that can be used in those fields to analyze and understand large sets of data, but after learning about the history and standards of the machine learning field i fell in love with it. </p>
